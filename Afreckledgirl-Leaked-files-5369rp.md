Afreckledgirl has released several singles and EPs since her debut, including "Fading Fast", "Ghost", and "Wildflower". Her music has been praised for its emotional intensity, melodic hooks, and sonic experimentation. Afreckledgirl is known for her high-energy live performances, which often feature her playing multiple instruments and showcasing her impressive vocal range. She has performed at festivals and venues across the UK and Europe, and has supported established artists such as Tom Odell and Lewis Capaldi. Afreckledgirl has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
